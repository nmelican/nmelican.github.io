      <article class="story">
        <h1>Site stylesheet--this is an H1 tag!</h1>
        <h2>This page defines all possible styles in this website. This is an H2 tag.</h2>
        <h3>And this is an H3 tag.</h3>
        <h4>Meanwhile, this is H4.</h4>
        <h5>Now this is H5.</h5>
        <h6>And finally, this is H6.</h6>
        <p class="byline">And this paragraph is for byline information. You know, the name of the person who created this story.</p>
        <p class="lead">And this paragraph is for the lead of the story. This is the first paragraph of the story and will probably have a drop cap or something special done to it.</p>
        <p class="ordinary">This is an <b>ordinary</b> paragraph. Whenever I lay out a book I like to build up my styles first. This HTML document is an attempt at replicating that discipline here.</p>
        <p class="alternative">Meanwhile, this is an alternative paragraph. These are the same two paragraphs. The difference is that one is used for sans-serif layouts and the other is used for serif layouts.</p>
        <p>Before I forget, this is a real, <i>ordinary</i> paragraph. Note that it looks like the ordinary paragraph above. That's because it's the default paragraph type. Oh, and here's <a href="#">a link</a>. Hope you see it well?</p>
        <p>Now, time for some figures.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1000x700" alt="Big Ass Image">
          <figcaption>This is a caption to the image above.</figcaption>
          <p class="caption">This is also a caption to the image above. The difference is that the text above was rendered using the <span class="monospace">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span> tag, while this paragraph is rendered using a <span class="monospace">&lt;p&gt;</span> tag with a <span class="monospace">caption</span> class. Oh, and you've seen monospace text now too!</p>
        </figure>
        <p>Now, some lists:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some</li>
          <li>List</li>
          <li>Here</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>What</li>
          <li>Are</li>
          <li>Your</li>
          <li>Priorities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="secheader">Now this is a section header class. You can apply this class to header items as well. It should look special, promise.</p>
        <p class="footnote">We're into footnote territory right now. This is an example of how a footnote will look like.</p>
        <p class="footnote">I think that's all the styles I will need for now? This document will continue to grow as more styles are needed or called for. But for what I wanna do, I think this is just about enough.</p>
      </article>
      <footer>
        <p class="footertext">This is how text in the footer should look like.</p>
